zzt on the web!

not very functional right now, its just a zzt file viewer at this point. but the cool part is it 
can load zzt files directly off the web via ajax request and display the boards. 

todo:

start animating things like pushers, transporters, spinning guns, etc<br>
ai for the monsters<br>
hiding the player on the title screens<br>
sound<br>
darkness and torches<br>
invisible walls<br>
zzt-oop<br>
possibly add a zoom control for screens with lots of room<br>
