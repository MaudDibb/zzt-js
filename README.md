zzt on the web!

not very functional right now, its just a zzt file viewer at this point. but the cool part is it 
can load zzt files directly off the web via ajax request and display the boards. 

todo:

get the blinking attribute going
start animating things like pushers, transporters, spinning guns, etc
ai for the monsters
hiding the player on the title screens
sound
darkness and torches
invisible walls
zzt-oop
possibly add a zoom control for screens with lots of room
